# Udacity SQL Project

This program was written to complete the 'Logs Analysis' project for 
Udacity's 'Full Stack Developer' course. It works by using the postgresql
Python library to make three queries to a given database. The three results
are then printed.

To run in the commandline, just do:

```
python newsdata.py
```

The 'news' database must be present.
